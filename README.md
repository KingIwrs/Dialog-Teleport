# Dialog-Teleport
A teleportation system using the dialog system added in 25w20a. In the pause menu there is a new button. The `Dialog Teleport` button.

Requires OP permissions to use since the commands are run by the player using it through the dialog menus.

(the gallery pictures are outdated... I might change them later, but the biggest change is just the autofilled inputs, and colors)
